1. Before starting implementation, design your code base. Design a class that will be in charge of reading the maze file.
- Make a list of methods and member variables you think it should have
: MazeWalker file will read the maze file.

2. Design a class that, given a valid maze, will traverse it.
- Make a list of member variables and method you think it should have.

3. Discuss how you plan to detect the need for backtracking should you reach a deadend in the maze. 
What will variables/objects/arrays will need to be updated when you backtrack?

4. Discuss how you plan to detect and handle finding an exit or running out of places to traverse
